TMake is still work under progress. The aim of this project is to make a functional and easy to use CLI
for making templates with a single command. What templates you ask? Well, competitive programmers need
quick file generator because many of us do get to know about a competition when we're just minutes away
from commencing.

To tackle this seemingly minute yet huge issue, I came up with an idea of making a CLI to help
competitive coders to get ready in a single command.
